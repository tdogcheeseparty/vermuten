# vermuten
German for "guess", vermuten is a very basic riddle/puzzle application. Upon server start, a config file that contains riddle information is loaded into memory and defines the riddles that a group of classmates must answer.

It is important to note that there is a single instance of this server so, if desired, multiple web browsers can be used to interact with the same game instance.

# Technologies
