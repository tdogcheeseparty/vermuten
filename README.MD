# vermuten
German for "guess", vermuten is a very basic riddle/puzzle application. Upon server start, a config file that contains riddle information is loaded into memory and defines the riddles that a group of classmates must answer.

It is important to note that there is a single instance of this server so, if desired, multiple web browsers can be used to interact with the same game instance.

# Technologies
* Python (language)
* Flask (web framework)
* Gunicorn (web server)
* Heroku (PaaS)

# Configuration
`VERMUTEN_CONFIG` must be set and point to a JSON config file within the root application directory. See `demo.json` for an example of the config format.

# Endpoints
## Game
### /
Returns the puzzle.

## Progress Report
### /admin/progress
Returns a status page.

## Progress Reset
### /admin/<config_file_name>/reset
Resets game progress and immediately redirects the user to `/`

**NOTE:** If the config file is named `demo.json` then the url would be `/admin/demo/reset`.
